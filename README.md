# SLI (Sign Language Interpreter)

SLI (Sign Language Interpreter) is an IT project aimed at developing a software application that can interpret sign language gestures and translate them into spoken or written language and vice-versa. This project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze and recognize sign language gestures, providing a means of communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

## Features

SLI offers the following features:

1. Gesture Recognition: The application can recognize and interpret sign language gestures performed by users.

2. Voice Recognition: The application can recognize and interpret voices performed by user who doesn't know sign language.

3. Translation: The interpreted gestures are translated into spoken language or displayed as written text and vice-versa, facilitating communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not.

4. Customization: The application can be customized to support different sign languages or dialects, allowing it to cater to various user communities.

5. Training Module: SLI provides a training module that enables users to train the system to recognize new gestures or improve the accuracy of gesture recognition.

6. Accessibility: The application aims to improve accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments, providing them with a tool to communicate effectively with others.
